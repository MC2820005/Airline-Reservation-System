# Airline-Reservation-System
- This is a desktop-based Airline Reservation System that allows users to:
- Log in or create an account
- Browse and search available flights
- Filter flights by origin, destination, and departure date
- Book flights with adult and child ticket selection
- View all personal reservations
- Click bookings to view full flight details
The application is built using Java, JavaFX, and PostgreSQL, with JDBC handling database connectivity and VSCode as my IDE.

How to run the program:
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the database is set up using schema.sql
- Ensure Java (JDK 17+) is installed
- Ensure JavaFX SDK is installed locally
- Double-click run.bat and the application will compile and launch automatically starting from Main.java
